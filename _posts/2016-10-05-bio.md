### Todd Evan Bowser was born in Moline, Illinois. He traveled to Iowa City when he was 18, and began writing and editing a music 'zine while making casual beginnings in space rock. He began playing guitar and keyboards with [Darling](https://sethknappen.bandcamp.com/album/the-floating-world) his early 20s and this was the beginning of his time as a touring and recording musician. With the break-up of Darling, he started moonlight between multiple bands in Iowa while working as a pizza cook, sound engineer, and bartender in an illegal speakeasy. In 2003, he fled the Midwest for Providence, Rhode Island, where he earned an associate's degree in culinary arts and played bass for Marah-Mar, and later Banana Hands, who would eventually become [The Brown Book](https://brownbook.bandcamp.com/album/thirty-nothing). He also met the artist [Elizabeth Alexander](http://elizabethalexanderstudio.com) who would help him make great breakthroughs with his home recording and eventually help bring him from rock shows to professional galleries as a sound artist.
### Todd and Elizabeth dated, each went back to school, moved around the country, and collaborated for nine years before marrying in Western Massachusetts in 2015, before moving to Winston-Salem at the end of that summer. 
### They have a dog named Chez, whose name sounds like shea, as in shea butter, which caught on, then was shortened to just "Butter," or "The Butter," hence the site title. Chez appears at 3:35 in the video below.
