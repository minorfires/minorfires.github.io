## Here is my concern.


*Coming at these tasks through several channels causes a bit of confusion.*

**Many** languages come into play and *multiple* formats for new initiates to juggle<br>
*may* cause ~~information~~ to not ~~sink in,~~ as some balls are heavier than others,<br>
_there's suddenly a beanbag,_ one ball is __pointy__ somehow.
<br><br>
It is difficult to not turn the juggling of formats into<br>
~~noise~~ ~~noise~~ ~~noise~~
~~noise~~ ~~noise~~ ~~noise~~
~~noise~~ ~~noise~~ ~~noise~~<br><br>
but there is shelter in layers of attempts and successes and failures through multiple commits along the journey. <br> Not [Journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdj8APyqvqw), but a journey.<br>

This is another type of [noise](https://minorfires.bandcamp.com/releases), conceived by the author.
