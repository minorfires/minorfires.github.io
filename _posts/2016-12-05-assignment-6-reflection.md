title: The Final Chapter
description: A deflating sensation.

## At last, the final project is in the can.

The final assignment dealt mostly with elements with which I was already familiar.
There were additional tasks that were shockingly within my comfort zone - sound recording and editing, which along with some of the basic markdown and html, made up the bulk of my contribution. I probably spent too much time poring over articles on our topic, hoping to find some sort of mind-blowing breakthrough. That might not have been there to find, but we managed to make something that was simple and interesting.
Of course it's great to be partnered with someone with a mastery of the materials, but Dylan's non-eye-batting efficiency with this project moved a little too quickly for me to really get a chance to let new material sink in and for me to evolve, not that I didn't learn from it.
On the other hand, it was great to not be stressing out about the project, and it really made me think about presentation, which is something I am only too familiar with.
I have a lot of issues with the aesthetic of PowerPoint - I will say more about this in my forthcoming community workshop post - so it was good to be exposed to a good alternative. However, swankifying the presentation caused some issues with the size and placement of text that we needed to deal with. Also, I learned how to nearly destroy a project by forcing a push of changes. How to get out of a disaster is also a valuable skill, and one that I'm certainly familiar with in other settings.
Also, the feeling that I've hydroplaned across the top of this project puts it on me to extend and apply knowledge in future applications of what I have been exposed to. That is my takeaway from the project and the class. All the information is here, and now in a pile in my brain. I look forward to making something of the pile.

Our presentation, a brief synopsis on Paul Otlet, is available [here](https://dylanjtastet.github.io/assignment6/#/).
