## A Mis-Adventure to the Library.

### In which our hero gets fairly lost in an effort to help others get found.
---
I was a part of the SILS community workshop series, where we partner with a few local public libraries to 
teach basic computer skills in one-time classes that are open to the public. There's a Google Doc that one
fills out to become a teacher or a floater.
I ended up floating for two classes, an introductory course and then a sort-of "next-level" course on 
Microsoft PowerPoint.
This conflicted with what we were doing in class at the time - just beginning to explore the alternatives to
PowerPoint and the Microsoft Monopoly Plan more generally. I had trouble getting over the irony of it.
I've been using PowerPoint for so long that I don't even think about how needlessly complicated it is.
It is a product whose primary purpose is to market itself. I did not have the option of questioning the 
value as I tried to help people older than myself try to navigate the software. It is a minefield of 
confusion, and it was painful to watch people with imperfect vision and only a limited comfort level with 
PCs more generally struggle with it. I thought more broadly about the way people incorporate technology 
into their lives, and about how much time and money - say, in a work environment - goes into training people 
on something like this, where the primary skill is sidestepping the very features that make it marketable.
On the other hand, people really believe in it, knowing no alternatives, and how would they know? It is a longer
conversation than there was time for to explore other ways people might present themselves. It is still really 
rewarding to help people get what they want from a piece of software. I can't really argue with another person's 
satisfaction. I found great joy in this most basic form of teaching, even with the frustration
inherent in trying to help a 65-year-old find the tiny little icon on their desktop that puts their slide show
into fullscreen mode. People were really happy with what they had done, and there is value in that, plus it is a
*great* experience to work in a room with people of varying abilities and goals. With all of the things we have
tried to assimilate over the semester, I hope I can nestle into this new pool of knowledge enough that I can pass 
it on.
