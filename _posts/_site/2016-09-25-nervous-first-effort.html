<hr />

<p><em>Coming at these tasks through several channels causes a bit of confusion.</em></p>

<p><strong>Many</strong> languages come into play and <em>multiple</em> formats for new initiates to juggle
<em>May</em> cause <del>information</del> to not <del>sink in,</del> as some balls are heavier than others,
<em>there’s suddenly a beanbag,</em> one ball is <strong>pointy</strong> somehow.</p>
<hr />

<p>It is difficult to not turn the juggling of formats into<br />
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del>
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del>
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del><br />
but there is shelter in layers of attempts and successes and failures through multiple commits along the journey. <br /> Not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdj8APyqvqw">Journey</a>.<br /></p>

<p>This is another type of <a href="https://minorfires.bandcamp.com/releases">noise</a> 
and there is a visual complement as well:<br /> <img src="http://artsake.massculturalcouncil.org/blog/artsake/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tea.jpg" alt="photo of cut porcelain" /><br />
This is a learning experience, and it’s not as hard as drinking from this cup would be, or as making it was.</p>
