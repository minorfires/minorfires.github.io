<p><em>Coming at these tasks through several channels causes a bit of confusion.</em></p>

<p><strong>Many</strong> languages come into play and <em>multiple</em> formats for new initiates to juggle<br />
<em>may</em> cause <del>information</del> to not <del>sink in,</del> as some balls are heavier than others,<br />
<em>there’s suddenly a beanbag,</em> one ball is <strong>pointy</strong> somehow.
<br /><br />
It is difficult to not turn the juggling of formats into<br />
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del>
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del>
<del>noise</del> <del>noise</del> <del>noise</del><br /><br />
but there is shelter in layers of attempts and successes and failures through multiple commits along the journey. <br /> Not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdj8APyqvqw">Journey</a>, but a journey.<br /></p>

<p>This is another type of <a href="https://minorfires.bandcamp.com/releases">noise</a>, conceived by the author.</p>
