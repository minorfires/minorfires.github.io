I generally have made buying decisions re: my equipment with the thought in mind that I could very easily wreck them through weird sound experiments that maybe should not have ever tried.</h3>

After wandering around an area of the campus I have only been to while lost (acknowledging how sad that is, but I am a SILS grad student - I go to two buildings and one of them is where I work), I managed to find where I was supposed to be - a very full room of students. We worked with a handful of basic parts. Each student was handed a breadboard, some lengths of wire, a resistor, and an LED. We produced a simple circuit on the breadboards and received a basic explanation of how it worked. We then were given some extra wires and a potentionmeter each, and created a circuit that allowed us to vary the brightness of the LED. I thought initially that the class could have been a little more advanced for college-age students. But then, even being familiar with the basic concepts involved, I was glad to receive the information as though I’d never heard it before, and little more than this could be delivered in an hour.  I plan to attend the introductory course in Arduino that is coming up. I mostly wish I had some time to devote to learning electronics. Anyway, it’s always useful to go back to the beginning. I often confuse that for working backwards, but it is in many cases the only way to move forward with certainty. Mostly, I want to quicken my pace on the bridge between the simple breadboard circuit…and this:</h3>
