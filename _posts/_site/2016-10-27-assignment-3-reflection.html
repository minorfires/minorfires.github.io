  <p>There is a secret that a friend taught me once for reading <em>really <strong>long</strong> books.</em></p>

    <p>You need only to force yourself through the first hundred pages.</p>

      <p>Perhaps there’s some adjustment for the total length; say, 200 pages if it’s <em>Infinite Jest.</em> So I guess that’s a way of describing my text. It’s a pause and a breath after the first “hundred pages” of this class and the program I’ve just begun, with a sort of map of what’s coming up.</p>

That part can be really hard, but if what we’re doing is at all worth it, then gaining that momentum is the only hard part.</h4>

<p>That, and maybe troubleshooting the scripts. It was fairly easy to follow the layout in the blank file and get Pandoc and TeXlive to function properly, and then get the filename to reproduce itself as the script directed the file conversions. When things got weird, the error messages that came up in the script’s trial runs were fairly easy to decipher and it wasn’t hard to try and err and persevere to figure it out.</p>

<p>Here, too, we’re in a web (<em>a metaphorical web, within the <strong>world wide one</strong></em>) of helpful resources. These resources are more or less distributed for free, and that’s amazing. I found an SaaS site for testing out my Markdown, which was as helpful as Jekyll, and I didn’t even have to save and click between tabs and reload.</p>

<p>If it’s clunky and weird to navigate the seemingly endless maze of tutorials and tools, <em>maybe it should be.</em> It’s a bunch of free stuff that people have left all over the place with the idea that genius isn’t all that rare and that everyone should have a shot at doing something great. It’s the same idea that made me want to become a librarian. Maybe using a computer in America should be like driving a car in Sweden: <strong>you should have to know something about how it works.</strong></p>
