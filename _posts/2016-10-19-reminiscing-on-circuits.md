### I attended one of the free tech courses at the Kenan Science Library. 
### I have fiddled, ill-advisedly, with my collection of electronic musical devices, for as long as I can remember. 
***
#### I generally have made my buying decisions for my equipment with the thought in mind that I could very easily wreck them through weird 
#### sound experiments that maybe should not have ever been.
***
### With this in mind, I thought it wise to get a little insight into what makes these and other gadgets work.
### After wandering around an area of the campus I have only been to while lost, I managed to find a very full room of students.
### We worked with a handful of basic parts. Each student was handed a breadboard, some lengths of wire, a resistor, and an LED.
### On one hand, I think the class could have been a little more advanced for college-age students.
