**dbyll** is a <a href="http://http://stephaniezimbalist.net/">Zimbalist</a>, okay-ish theme for Jekyll. Supports <a href="http://my.ign.com/atari/gravitar">Gravitar</a>, account links (github, twitter, e-mail, pinterest, r√©sume file) and a bio.  

**dbyll** is brought to you by **[dbtek](http://ismaildemirbilek.com)**. Open sourced under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license. Links have been altered to lead to amusing visual and aural internet japes.

### <i>dbyll was never meant to look this way. All apologies to dbtek.</i>
